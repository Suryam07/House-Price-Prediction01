Project Steps in Detail

1. Data Understanding

Analyze the dataset to understand its structure.

Identify target and feature columns.

Check for missing values and data types.

2. Data Preparation

Imputation: Fill missing values using appropriate strategies (mean/median for numerical data, mode for categorical data).

Scaling: Standardize numerical features to improve model performance.

Encoding: Convert categorical features using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Feature Engineering: Add derived features such as "price per square foot" or "distance to city center" (if applicable).

3. Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualize feature distributions.

Explore correlations between features and the target variable.

Identify and handle outliers.

4. Model Development

Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20 split).

Train models such as:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)

Evaluate models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.

Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

5. Prediction Pipeline

Automate preprocessing, model training, and prediction using Scikit-learn pipelines.

Save the trained model using libraries like joblib or pickle.

6. Deployment (Optional)

Use a web framework to create an interface for predictions.

Deploy the model on platforms like Heroku or AWS.

Future Improvements

Incorporate additional features from external data sources (e.g., census data).

Experiment with deep learning models.

Enhance deployment by integrating with a front-end interface.
